## wrespy

A wrapper for `wrestool` that permits batch-extracting icons and other resources from Windows executables (NE/PE).

The goal is providing a quick way to batch-extract graphical resources (namely icons) from original install media (including CAB archives and such), thus hopefully reducing the need to install programs in a virtual machine to get their icons.

The name `wrespy` is a tribute to this tool's heritage and inspiration.
