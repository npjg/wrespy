## wrespy

A wrapper for `wrestool` that permits batch-extracting icons and other resources from Windows executables (NE/PE). Think of the goal as rather like [resource_dasm](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/resource_dasm), but for Windows executables.

The `wrestool` command-line utlity is a required dependency. The name `wrespy` is a tribute to this tool's heritage and inspiration.
